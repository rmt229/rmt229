Hi! My name is Raquel Taborga. I am a senior/M.Eng student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY.
This is my school account, and I am in the process of transferring my projects to my personal account. A lot of my projects are on 
the course's repository, or a company's private repository. I have included links to websites detailing these projects as best I can.

ECE 4760: Design with Microcontrollers Final Project: https://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/ece4760/FinalProjects/s2021/rmt229_jad452_prw56/final_project_website/index.html

If you have been linked here from my resume, I have hyperlinked projects and websites right from there. 

If there is any project you would like to access or have any questions on, you can reach me at: rmt229@cornell.edu
