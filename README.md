Hi! My name is Raquel Taborga. I am a senior/M.Eng student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY.
This is my school account, and I am in the process of transferring my projects to my personal account.
In the meantime, if there is any project you would like to access or have any questions on, you can reach me at: rmt229@cornell.edu
